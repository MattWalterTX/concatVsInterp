### Concatenation vs Interpolation

> Concatenation as I understand is physically putting string together such as
> “Hello,” + “ I hope you are well today.” to get a return like “Hello, I hope
> you have a good day.” This seems to be a very easy concept to to learn and
> apply directly in many ways, but it limited.

>Interpolation, however, would allow you to make any or all of the component
> strings into active variables. I see this being a LOT harder to get a handle
> on but exponentially more useful longterm. Much like using an integer instead
> of a variable, interpolation would allow you to set up a large bank of string
> options with conditions for each. Thus making altering your code so much
> easier as data is added.

>So which do I like better? Right now i am going to say concatenation because it seems much easier to grasp currently. But give me time, I really do like the idea of limitless options going forward.
